                Of course! Let's break down the problem into simpler parts to understand it better.<br><br>First, we need to understand the process of bacterial proliferation described in the problem. The bacteria divide in such a way that each bacterium splits into two daughter cells. This means that the number of bacteria doubles with each proliferation.<br><br>Let's start with the initial number of bacteria, which is 1. After the first proliferation, this single bacterium will divide into 2 bacteria. After the second proliferation, each of these 2 bacteria will divide into 2 more, resulting in 4 bacteria. This doubling continues with each proliferation.<br><br>To solve the problem, we need to find out how many bacteria there will be after 5 proliferations, starting from 1 bacterium.<br><br>Here's a step-by-step approach to think about it:<br><br>1. **Initial Condition**: Start with 1 bacterium.<br>2. **First Proliferation**: The number of bacteria doubles.<br>3. **Second Proliferation**: The number of bacteria doubles again.<br>4. **Third Proliferation**: The number of bacteria doubles again.<br>5. **Fourth Proliferation**: The number of bacteria doubles again.<br>6. **Fifth Proliferation**: The number of bacteria doubles again.<br><br>Can you think about how we can represent this doubling process mathematically? What formula might apply here?

                I am not sure, can you give an example?

                Sure, let's look at a similar example to help you understand the pattern. Imagine we start with 1 bacterium and we want to see how many bacteria there are after 3 proliferations.<br><br>1. **Initial Condition**: We start with 1 bacterium.<br>2. **First Proliferation**: The 1 bacterium divides into 2 bacteria.<br>3. **Second Proliferation**: Each of the 2 bacteria divides into 2 more, resulting in 4 bacteria.<br>4. **Third Proliferation**: Each of the 4 bacteria divides into 2 more, resulting in 8 bacteria.<br><br>We can represent this mathematically as follows:<br>- After 0 proliferations: <span class="math">\( 1 \times 2^0 = 1 \)</span><br>- After 1 proliferation: <span class="math">\( 1 \times 2^1 = 2 \)</span><br>- After 2 proliferations: <span class="math">\( 1 \times 2^2 = 4 \)</span><br>- After 3 proliferations: <span class="math">\( 1 \times 2^3 = 8 \)</span><br><br>Notice the pattern? The number of bacteria after <span class="math">\( n \)</span> proliferations can be represented as <span class="math">\( 2^n \)</span>.<br><br>Now, let's apply this to your original problem where we need to find the number of bacteria after 5 proliferations. Can you try to calculate it using the pattern we just discussed?

                2^5 = 32.

                <strong>Assistant:</strong><br>
                Exactly! You've got it right. After 5 proliferations, starting with 1 bacterium, the number of bacteria will be <span class="math">\( 2^5 = 32 \)</span>.<br><br>To break it down step-by-step:<br>- After 0 proliferations: <span class="math">\( 2^0 = 1 \)</span><br>- After 1 proliferation: <span class="math">\( 2^1 = 2 \)</span><br>- After 2 proliferations: <span class="math">\( 2^2 = 4 \)</span><br>- After 3 proliferations: <span class="math">\( 2^3 = 8 \)</span><br>- After 4 proliferations: <span class="math">\( 2^4 = 16 \)</span><br>- After 5 proliferations: <span class="math">\( 2^5 = 32 \)</span><br><br>You've successfully applied the concept of exponential growth to solve the problem. Great job!<br><br>Now, think about how you could apply this method to a similar problem. For example, if you started with 2 bacteria instead of 1, how many bacteria would there be after 5 proliferations? Can you figure out the formula for this scenario?

                <strong>Assistant:</strong><br>
                That's correct! If you start with 2 bacteria and each bacterium divides into two after each proliferation, the number of bacteria will double with each step.<br><br>Let's break it down:<br><br>- **Initial Condition**: Start with 2 bacteria.<br>- **First Proliferation**: <span class="math">\( 2 \times 2 = 4 \)</span> bacteria.<br>- **Second Proliferation**: <span class="math">\( 4 \times 2 = 8 \)</span> bacteria.<br>- **Third Proliferation**: <span class="math">\( 8 \times 2 = 16 \)</span> bacteria.<br>- **Fourth Proliferation**: <span class="math">\( 16 \times 2 = 32 \)</span> bacteria.<br>- **Fifth Proliferation**: <span class="math">\( 32 \times 2 = 64 \)</span> bacteria.<br><br>Mathematically, if you start with 2 bacteria, the number of bacteria after <span class="math">\( n \)</span> proliferations can be represented as <span class="math">\( 2 \times 2^n \)</span> or <span class="math">\( 2^{n+1} \)</span>.<br><br>So, after 5 proliferations, the number of bacteria is <span class="math">\( 2 \times 2^5 = 2 \times 32 = 64 \)</span>.<br><br>You've applied the concept well! Can you think of another scenario where you might use exponential growth, perhaps in a different context?
