                Of course! Let's think about the problem step by step. Imagine you start with a single bacterium. In the first proliferation, this bacterium divides into two. Now, you have 2 bacteria. In the next step, each of these 2 bacteria divides again, giving you 4 bacteria. This process continues, with the number of bacteria doubling each time.<br><br>So, if you start with 1 bacterium and it doubles every time it proliferates, how many bacteria will there be after 5 proliferations? The key here is to recognize that the number of bacteria follows a pattern of exponential growth, doubling each time.

                Great question! Proliferation refers to the process of rapid increase or reproduction, especially of cells or organisms. In this context, it means the bacteria are dividing and increasing in number. Each time a bacterium divides, it creates two daughter cells, leading to a doubling of the number of bacteria.<br><br>So, if you start with 1 bacterium and it divides (or proliferates) once, you end up with 2 bacteria. If each of those 2 bacteria divides again, you end up with 4 bacteria, and so on. Can you see how the number of bacteria doubles with each proliferation?

                Understanding whether a problem follows exponential growth involves recognizing a few key characteristics:<br><br>1. **Constant Multiplicative Factor**: In exponential growth, the quantity increases by a constant factor at each step. For example, if something doubles every time period, it follows exponential growth.<br><br>2. **Doubling or Multiplying Pattern**: Look for patterns where the quantity is multiplied by a fixed number at each step. For instance, if a quantity doubles every period, triples every period, or increases by any fixed factor, it is likely exponential growth.<br><br>3. **Exponential Function Form**: Mathematically, exponential growth can be represented by the function <span class="math">\( y = a \cdot b^n \)</span>, where:<br>   - <span class="math">\( a \)</span> is the initial value.<br>   - <span class="math">\( b \)</span> is the growth factor (the constant factor by which the quantity increases).<br>   - <span class="math">\( n \)</span> is the number of time periods.<br><br>Let's apply this to the bacteria problem:<br><br>- **Initial Condition**: You start with 1 bacterium (<span class="math">\( a = 1 \)</span>).<br>- **Growth Factor**: Each bacterium divides into 2 (<span class="math">\( b = 2 \)</span>).<br>- **Number of Proliferations**: <span class="math">\( n \)</span>.<br><br>The formula becomes <span class="math">\( y = 1 \cdot 2^n \)</span>, or simply <span class="math">\( y = 2^n \)</span>.<br><br>Here’s how you can identify exponential growth in other problems:<br><br>- **Population Growth**: If a population doubles every year, it follows exponential growth.<br>- **Compound Interest**: If an investment grows by a fixed percentage each year, it follows exponential growth.<br>- **Spread of Diseases**: If the number of infected people doubles every day, it follows exponential growth.<br><br>To summarize, look for problems where the quantity increases by a constant factor at each step.

                Great! You've got it right. The number of bacteria after 5 proliferations is indeed 32.

                As for every proliferation, the number doubles, it can be represented as 2^n (2 to the power n). Here n is the number of proliferations. For example, 2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8. This is an exponential growth process where the value grows quickly as the number of proliferations increases. So continuing this for 5 times, 2*2*2*2*2 or 2^5 is 32 which is the answer. Is this the explanation?

                Yes, that's exactly right! You've got the explanation spot on.

                Of course! Here’s a similar problem involving exponential growth:<br><br>**Problem Name: Population Growth**<br>**Subject Area: Math**<br>**Subtopic: Number Series**<br><br>**Problem Statement:**<br>A small town has a population of 1,000 people. The population doubles every 10 years due to a high birth rate. What will the population be after 50 years?<br><br>**Hints:**<br>- Think about how the population doubles every 10 years.<br>- Use the formula <span class="math">\( P = P_0 \cdot 2^n \)</span>, where <span class="math">\( P_0 \)</span> is the initial population, and <span class="math">\( n \)</span> is the number of 10-year periods.<br><br>**Solution:**<br>1. **Initial Condition**: The initial population <span class="math">\( P_0 \)</span> is 1,000 people.<br>2. **Growth Process**: The population doubles every 10 years.<br><br>To find the population after 50 years:<br>- Number of 10-year periods in 50 years: <span class="math">\( n = \frac{50}{10} = 5 \)</span>.<br><br>Using the formula <span class="math">\( P = P_0 \cdot 2^n \)</span>:<br>- <span class="math">\( P = 1000 \cdot 2^5 \)</span><br>- <span class="math">\( P = 1000 \cdot 32 \)</span><br>- <span class="math">\( P = 32,000 \)</span><br><br>So, the population after 50 years will be 32,000 people.<br><br>**Explanation:**<br>The population doubles every 10 years, so the number of people grows exponentially.
