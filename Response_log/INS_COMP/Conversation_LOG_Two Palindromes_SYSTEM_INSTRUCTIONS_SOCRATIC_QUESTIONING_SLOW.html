                Palindromes can indeed be numbers, but they can also be words or sequences that read the same backward as forward. In this problem, we are specifically dealing with numerical palindromes. Can you think about the structure of a 4-digit palindrome and how it might look?

                Of course! The problem involves a 4-digit number <span class="math">\( x \)</span> that is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same backward as forward.

                Certainly!

                That's a great question! The problem specifically states that <span class="math">\( x \)</span> is a 4-digit palindrome, and we need to find such an <span class="math">\( x \)</span> that when 212 is added to it, the result is a 5-digit palindrome.<br><br>To ensure <span class="math">\( x \)</span> is a palindrome, we need to consider the structure of <span class="math">\( x \)</span>.

                Looking at the minimum and maximum values of <span class="math">\( x \)</span> helps us narrow down the range of possible values and ensures we consider all potential candidates.

                The maximum possible value of x is 9999, which gives a maximum value for x + 212 as 10211. The minimum value of x + 212 is 10000 as it's a 5-digit number. We get that the first two digits of x must be 10, hence the last two must be 01 (since it's a palindrome). There are only 3 possible cases for x + 212: 10001, 10101, or 10201. Only 10101 gives a valid palindrome value for x, which is 9889, and the sum of its digits is 34.

                That's correct! Let's break down the reasoning to ensure everything is clear:<br><br>1. **Form of <span class="math">\( x \)</span>**: <span class="math">\( x \)</span> is a 4-digit palindrome, so it has the form <span class="math">\( abba \)</span>.<br><br>2. **Range of <span class="math">\( x + 212 \)</span>**: <span class="math">\( x + 212 \)</span> must be a 5-digit palindrome, which means it ranges from 10000 to 99999.<br><br>3. **Finding <span class="math">\( x \)</span>**:<br>   - The smallest 5-digit palindrome is 10001.<br>   - If <span class="math">\( x + 212 = 10001 \)</span>, then <span class="math">\( x = 10001 - 212 = 9789 \)</span>.<br>   - Check if 9789 is a palindrome: No, it is not.<br><br>4. **Next Possible Value**:<br>   - The next 5-digit palindrome is 10101.<br>   - If <span class="math">\( x + 212 = 10101 \)</span>, then <span class="math">\( x = 10101 - 212 = 9889 \)</span>.<br>   - Check if 9

                Thanks for helping. Can you provide an example similar to this one?

                Certainly! Here's a similar problem for you to practice:<br><br>**Problem Statement:**<br>A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. Let <span class="math">\( y \)</span> be a 3-digit palindrome. When 121 is added to <span class="math">\( y \)</span>, the result is a 4-digit palindrome. What is the sum of the digits of <span class="math">\( y \)</span>?<br><br>**Steps to Solve:**<br><br>1. **Form of <span class="math">\( y \)</span>**: <span class="math">\( y \)</span> is a 3-digit palindrome, so it has the form <span class="math">\( aba \)</span>. For example, 121, 343, etc.<br><br>2. **Range of <span class="math">\( y + 121 \)</span>**: <span class="math">\( y + 121 \)</span> must be a 4-digit palindrome, which means it ranges from 1000 to 9999.<br><br>3. **Finding <span class="math">\( y \)</span>**:<br>   - The smallest 4-digit palindrome is 1001.<br>   - If <span class="math">\( y + 121 = 1001 \)</span>, then <span class="math">\( y = 1001 - 121 = 880 \)</span>.<br>   - Check if 880 is a palindrome: No, it is not.
