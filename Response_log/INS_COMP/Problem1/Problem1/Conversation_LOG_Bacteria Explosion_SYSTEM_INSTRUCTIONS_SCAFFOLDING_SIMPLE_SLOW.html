                Certainly! Exponential growth is a pattern of data that shows greater increases with passing time, creating the curve of an exponential function.

                To determine if a problem follows exponential growth, you can look for a few key characteristics:<br><br>1. **Constant Multiplicative Rate**: In exponential growth, the quantity increases by a constant factor at each time interval. This means that the growth rate is proportional to the current value of the quantity.<br><br>2. **Doubling or Multiplying Pattern**: If the quantity doubles, triples, or multiplies by a constant factor at regular intervals, it is likely following exponential growth.<br><br>3. **Exponential Function Form**: The mathematical form of exponential growth is <span class="math">\(N = N_0 \cdot r^n\)</span>, where:<br>   - <span class="math">\(N\)</span> is the quantity at time <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.<br>   - <span class="math">\(N_0\)</span> is the initial quantity.<br>   - <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is the growth factor.<br>   - <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is the number of time periods.<br><br>Let's apply these characteristics to the bacterial proliferation problem:<br><br>1. **Initial Condition**: You start with 1 bacterium.<br>2. **Growth Pattern**: Each bacterium divides into 2 daughter cells, doubling the number of bacteria at each proliferation.<br>3. **Mathematical Form**: The number of bacteria after <span class="math">\(n\)</span> proliferations can be represented as <span class="math">\(N = 1 \cdot 2^n\)</span>.<br><br>Here

                As for every proliferation, the number doubles, it can be represented as 2^n (2 to the power n). Here n is the number of proliferations. For example, 2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8. This is an exponential growth process where the value grows quickly as the number of proliferations increases. So continuing this for 5 times, 2*2*2*2*2 or 2^5 is 32 which is the answer. Is this the explanation?

                Yes, that's exactly right! You've understood the concept perfectly.
