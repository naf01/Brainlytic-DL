                Certainly! Exponential growth is a pattern of data that shows greater increases with passing time, creating the curve of an exponential function. In mathematical terms, exponential growth occurs when the rate of change of a quantity is proportional to the current amount of that quantity.<br><br>Let's break it down further:<br><br>1. **Definition**: Exponential growth happens when a quantity increases by a constant factor over equal intervals of time. This means that the growth rate is proportional to the current value.<br><br>2. **Formula**: The general formula for exponential growth is:<br>   <div class="math-block">\[<br>   P(t) = P_0 \cdot (1 + r)^t<br>   \]</div><br>   where:<br>   - <span class="math">\( P(t) \)</span> is the quantity at time <span class="math">\( t \)</span>,<br>   - <span class="math">\( P_0 \)</span> is the initial quantity,<br>   - <span class="math">\( r \)</span> is the growth rate (expressed as a decimal),<br>   - <span class="math">\( t \)</span> is the time.<br><br>3. **Example in Bacteria Growth**: In the bacteria proliferation problem, the number of bacteria doubles with each proliferation. This can be expressed as:<br>   <div class="math-block">\[<br>   B(n) = B_0 \cdot 2^n<br>   \]</div><br>   where:<br>   - <span class="math">\( B(n) \)</span> is the number of bacteria

                Understanding whether a problem follows exponential growth involves recognizing specific patterns and characteristics. Here are some key points to consider:<br><br>1. **Doubling or Multiplying by a Constant Factor**: Exponential growth occurs when a quantity increases by a constant factor over equal intervals of time. For example, if a quantity doubles every period, it follows exponential growth.<br><br>2. **Rate of Change Proportional to Current Value**: In exponential growth, the rate of change of the quantity is proportional to the current value of the quantity. This means that the larger the quantity, the faster it grows.<br><br>3. **Exponential Function Form**: The mathematical form of exponential growth is typically <span class="math">\( P(t) = P_0 \cdot (1 + r)^t \)</span>, where <span class="math">\( P_0 \)</span> is the initial quantity, <span class="math">\( r \)</span> is the growth rate, and <span class="math">\( t \)</span> is time. In some cases, it might be simplified to <span class="math">\( P(t) = P_0 \cdot a^t \)</span>, where <span class="math">\( a \)</span> is the growth factor.<br><br>4. **Graphical Representation**: On a graph, exponential growth is represented by a curve that starts off slowly and then increases rapidly. The curve becomes steeper as time progresses.<br><br>Let's apply these points to the bacteria

                As for every proliferation, the number doubles, it can be represented as 2^n (2 to the power n). Here n is the number of proliferations. For example, 2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8. This is an exponential growth process where the value grows quickly as the number of proliferations increases. So continuing this for 5 times, 2*2*2*2*2 or 2^5 is 32 which is the answer.
