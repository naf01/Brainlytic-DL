                Sure! The problem is about bacteria that double in number each time they proliferate. If you start with 1 bacterium, after each proliferation, the number of bacteria doubles.

                Proliferation in this context means the process of the bacteria multiplying or increasing in number. Specifically, each bacterium divides into two, doubling the total number of bacteria each time. <br><br>So, if you start with 1 bacterium, after one proliferation, you'll have 2. After another proliferation, you'll have 4, and so on. Can you see how the number of bacteria changes with each proliferation?

                Of course! The problem is about bacteria that double in number each time they proliferate. You start with 1 bacterium.

                Certainly! Let's think about it step-by-step using a table to see the pattern more clearly:<br><br>| Proliferation | Number of Bacteria |<br>|---------------|--------------------|<br>| 0             | 1                  |<br>| 1             | 2                  |<br>| 2             | 4                  |<br>| 3             | 8                  |<br>| 4             | 16                 |<br>| 5             | ?                  |<br><br>Each time the bacteria proliferate, the number doubles. So, if you start with 1 bacterium, after each step, you multiply the number by 2. Can you fill in the number of bacteria after 5 proliferations based on this pattern?

                Sure! Exponential growth occurs when the quantity increases by a constant factor at each step. In this case, the number of bacteria doubles with each proliferation.<br><br>Here’s a simple breakdown:<br><br>1. **Initial amount**: Start with 1 bacterium.<br>2. **Growth factor**: Each proliferation, the number of bacteria doubles (growth factor is 2).<br>3. **Number of steps**: After <span class="math">\(n\)</span> proliferations, the number of bacteria is <span class="math">\(2^n\)</span>.<br><br>For example:<br>- After 1 proliferation: <span class="math">\(2^1 = 2\)</span><br>- After 2 proliferations: <span class="math">\(2^2 = 4\)</span><br>- After 3 proliferations: <span class="math">\(2^3 = 8\)</span><br>- After 4 proliferations: <span class="math">\(2^4 = 16\)</span><br>- After 5 proliferations: <span class="math">\(2^5 = 32\)</span><br><br>So, exponential growth means the quantity grows very quickly as the number of steps increases.

                Great question! To determine if a problem follows exponential growth, look for these key characteristics:<br><br>1. **Constant Multiplicative Factor**: The quantity increases by a constant factor at each step. For example, if something doubles each time, triples each time, etc.<br>2. **Repetitive Multiplication**: The growth is based on repeated multiplication rather than addition. For example, if you start with 1 and it doubles each step, you get 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.<br>3. **Exponential Form**: The quantity can often be expressed in the form <span class="math">\(a \cdot b^n\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is the initial amount, <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is the growth factor, and <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is the number of steps.<br><br>For example:<br>- **Bacteria Problem**: The number of bacteria doubles each time, so it follows <span class="math">\(2^n\)</span>.<br>- **Money Doubling**: If you have money that doubles every year, it follows exponential growth.<br><br>Does this help you identify exponential growth in problems?

                If there is 1 bacteria at the beginning, there should be 2 after the first division, 3 after the 2nd, and 4 after the 3rd, 5 after the 4th and 6 finally.

                It looks like there might be a misunderstanding. In this problem, the bacteria double each time they proliferate, not just increase by one. Let's clarify:<br><br>1. **Initial amount**: Start with 1 bacterium.<br>2. **After 1 proliferation**: The 1 bacterium divides into 2, so you have <span class="math">\(2\)</span> bacteria.<br>3. **After 2 proliferations**: Each of the 2 bacteria divides, resulting in <span class="math">\(2 \times 2 = 4\)</span> bacteria.<br>4. **After 3 proliferations**: Each of the 4 bacteria divides, resulting in <span class="math">\(4 \times 2 = 8\)</span> bacteria.<br>5. **After 4 proliferations**: Each of the 8 bacteria divides, resulting in <span class="math">\(8 \times 2 = 16\)</span> bacteria.<br>6. **After 5 proliferations**: Each of the 16 bacteria divides, resulting in <span class="math">\(16 \times 2 = 32\)</span> bacteria.<br><br>So, after 5 proliferations, you have 32 bacteria.

                As for every proliferation, the number doubles, it can be represented as 2^n (2 to the power n). Here n is the number of proliferations. For example, 2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8. This is an exponential growth process where the value grows quickly as the number of proliferations increases. So continuing this for 5 times, 2*2*2*2*2 or 2^5 is 32 which is the answer.
