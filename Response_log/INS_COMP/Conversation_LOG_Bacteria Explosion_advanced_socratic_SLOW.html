                Certainly! Exponential growth is a pattern of data that shows greater increases with passing time, creating the curve of an exponential function.

                To determine if a problem follows exponential growth, you can look for a few key characteristics:<br><br>1. **Constant Multiplicative Factor**: In exponential growth, the quantity increases by a constant factor at each step. For example, if the quantity doubles every time period, triples every time period, etc., it is likely exponential growth.<br><br>2. **Doubling Time or Growth Rate**: If the problem mentions a specific time period during which the quantity doubles, triples, or increases by a fixed factor, it is a strong indicator of exponential growth.<br><br>3. **Exponential Function Form**: The mathematical form of exponential growth is typically <span class="math">\(y = a \cdot b^x\)</span>, where:<br>   - <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is the initial value.<br>   - <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is the growth factor (greater than 1 for growth).<br>   - <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is the number of time periods.<br><br>4. **Graph Shape**: If you plot the data, exponential growth will show a characteristic upward curve, where the rate of increase becomes steeper over time.<br><br>Let's apply this to the bacteria proliferation problem:<br>- **Initial Condition**: You start with 1 bacterium.<br>- **First Proliferation**: The 1 bacterium divides into 2 bacteria.<br>- **Second Proliferation

                As for every proliferation, the number doubles, it can be represented as 2^n (2 to the power n). Here n is the number of proliferations. For example, 2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8. This is an exponential growth process where the value grows quickly as the number of proliferations increases. So continuing this for 5 times, 2*2*2*2*2 or 2^5 is 32 which is the answer.
