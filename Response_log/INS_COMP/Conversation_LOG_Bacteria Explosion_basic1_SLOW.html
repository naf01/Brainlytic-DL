                Sure! The problem is about bacteria that double in number each time they proliferate. If you start with 1 bacterium, after each proliferation, the number of bacteria doubles.

                Proliferation in this context means the process of the bacteria multiplying or increasing in number. Specifically, each bacterium divides into two, doubling the total number of bacteria each time. So, with each proliferation, the number of bacteria doubles. Does this help clarify the process?

                Sure! Exponential growth occurs when the quantity increases by a constant factor at each step.

                Great question! To determine if a problem follows exponential growth, look for these key characteristics:<br><br>1. **Constant Multiplicative Factor**: The quantity increases by a constant factor at each step. For example, if the quantity doubles each time, triples each time, etc.<br><br>2. **Rapid Increase**: The growth becomes faster over time, leading to a rapid increase in the quantity.<br><br>3. **Pattern Recognition**: You can often recognize exponential growth by the pattern in the numbers. For example, if you see numbers like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc., this is a clear sign of exponential growth because each number is a power of 2.<br><br>4. **Formula**: Exponential growth can often be described by a formula of the form <span class="math">\(y = a \cdot b^n\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is the initial amount, <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is the growth factor, and <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is the number of time periods.<br><br>In the bacteria problem, the number of bacteria doubles each time, which fits the pattern of exponential growth. If you see a similar pattern in another problem, it likely follows exponential growth.<br><br>Does this help you identify exponential growth in problems?

                It looks like there might be a misunderstanding. In this problem, the bacteria double each time they proliferate, not just increase by one. Let's clarify:<br><br>- **Initial amount**: 1 bacterium<br>- **After 1 proliferation**: <span class="math">\(1 \times 2 = 2\)</span> bacteria<br>- **After 2 proliferations**: <span class="math">\(2 \times 2 = 4\)</span> bacteria<br>- **After 3 proliferations**: <span class="math">\(4 \times 2 = 8\)</span> bacteria<br>- **After 4 proliferations**: <span class="math">\(8 \times 2 = 16\)</span> bacteria<br>- **After 5 proliferations**: <span class="math">\(16 \times 2 = 32\)</span> bacteria<br><br>So, after each proliferation, the number of bacteria doubles.

                You're on the right track with the idea of a geometric series, but there's a small misunderstanding.

                As for every proliferation, the number doubles, it can be represented as 2^n (2 to the power n). Here n is the number of proliferations. For example, 2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8. This is an exponential growth process where the value grows quickly as the number of proliferations increases. So continuing this for 5 times, 2*2*2*2*2 or 2^5 is 32 which is the answer.
