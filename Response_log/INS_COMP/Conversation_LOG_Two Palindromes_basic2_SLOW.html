                Sure! The problem asks you to find a 4-digit palindrome number <span class="math">\( x \)</span> such that when you add 212 to it, the result is a 5-digit palindrome number. Your goal is to find <span class="math">\( x \)</span> and then calculate the sum of its digits. Let's start by thinking about the range of possible values for <span class="math">\( x \)</span> and <span class="math">\( x + 212 \)</span>. What do you think the range of <span class="math">\( x \)</span> should be?

                Yes, in this context, palindromes are numbers that read the same backward as forward. For example, 1221 and 3443 are palindromic numbers. Let's focus on finding the 4-digit palindrome <span class="math">\( x \)</span> such that <span class="math">\( x + 212 \)</span> is a 5-digit palindrome. What do you think the smallest and largest 4-digit palindromes are?

                Of course! We need to find a 4-digit palindrome <span class="math">\( x \)</span> such that when you add 212 to it, the result is a 5-digit palindrome. A palindrome reads the same backward as forward. For example, 1221 is a palindrome. Your task is to find <span class="math">\( x \)</span> and then find the sum of its digits. Let's start by considering the range of <span class="math">\( x \)</span>. Since <span class="math">\( x + 212 \)</span> must be a 5-digit number, what is the smallest possible value for <span class="math">\( x \)</span>?

                Certainly! Let's approach it differently. We know <span class="math">\( x \)</span> is a 4-digit palindrome, so it looks like <span class="math">\( abba \)</span> where <span class="math">\( a \)</span> and <span class="math">\( b \)</span> are digits. When you add 212 to <span class="math">\( x \)</span>, the result is a 5-digit palindrome. The smallest 5-digit palindrome is 10001. So, <span class="math">\( x + 212 \geq 10001 \)</span>. This means <span class="math">\( x \geq 9789 \)</span>. Since <span class="math">\( x \)</span> is a palindrome, what are the possible values for <span class="math">\( x \)</span> around 9789? Try to find a palindrome close to this value and check if adding 212 results in a 5-digit palindrome.

                Don't be too hard on yourself! This problem can be tricky, but you can definitely figure it out with some guidance. Let's break it down further. We know <span class="math">\( x \)</span> is a 4-digit palindrome, so it looks like <span class="math">\( abba \)</span>. When you add 212 to <span class="math">\( x \)</span>, the result must be a 5-digit palindrome. Let's start with the smallest 5-digit palindrome, which is 10001. If <span class="math">\( x + 212 = 10001 \)</span>, then <span class="math">\( x = 10001 - 212 \)</span>. Calculate <span class="math">\( x \)</span> and check if it's a palindrome. If not, try the next 5-digit palindrome, 10101, and so on. You can do this!

                I understand you're in a hurry, but let's try to solve it step-by-step quickly. We know <span class="math">\( x \)</span> is a 4-digit palindrome and <span class="math">\( x + 212 \)</span> is a 5-digit palindrome. Let's start with <span class="math">\( x + 212 = 10101 \)</span>. Then <span class="math">\( x = 10101 - 212 = 9889 \)</span>. Check if 9889 is a palindrome (it is). Now, sum the digits of 9889: <span class="math">\( 9 + 8 + 8 + 9 = 34 \)</span>. So, the sum of the digits of <span class="math">\( x \)</span> is 34. Can you see how we arrived at this?

                Great question! Palindromes can be of any length, not just even. Here are some examples:<br><br>- 3-digit palindrome: 121<br>- 4-digit palindrome: 1221<br>- 5-digit palindrome: 12321<br>- 6-digit palindrome: 123321<br><br>Notice how they read the same backward as forward. For the problem at hand, we focused on 4-digit and 5-digit palindromes. Do you see how the structure of these palindromes helps in solving the problem?

                Good question! The problem specifically states that <span class="math">\( x \)</span> is a 4-digit palindrome. We need to find such an <span class="math">\( x \)</span> where <span class="math">\( x + 212 \)</span> is a 5-digit palindrome. The key is to start with the condition that <span class="math">\( x \)</span> is a palindrome and then check if <span class="math">\( x + 212 \)</span> meets the palindrome condition.<br><br>For example, if <span class="math">\( x = 9889 \)</span>, which is a palindrome, then <span class="math">\( x + 212 = 10101 \)</span>, which is also a palindrome. This confirms that <span class="math">\( x \)</span> is indeed a palindrome and satisfies the condition given in the problem.<br><br>So, we start by assuming <span class="math">\( x \)</span> is a palindrome and then verify if <span class="math">\( x + 212 \)</span> is a palindrome. This approach ensures that <span class="math">\( x \)</span> remains a palindrome.

                To find the value of <span class="math">\( x \)</span>, let's follow these steps:<br><br>1. **Identify the range for <span class="math">\( x \)</span>**: Since <span class="math">\( x + 212 \)</span> must be a 5-digit palindrome, the smallest possible value for <span class="math">\( x + 212 \)</span> is 10001. Therefore, <span class="math">\( x \geq 10001 - 212 = 9789 \)</span>.<br><br>2. **Check possible 4-digit palindromes**: Start with the smallest 4-digit palindrome greater than or equal to 9789, which is 9889.<br><br>3. **Verify if <span class="math">\( x + 212 \)</span> is a palindrome**: Calculate <span class="math">\( 9889 + 212 = 10101 \)</span>. Check if 10101 is a palindrome (it is).<br><br>4. **Sum the digits of <span class="math">\( x \)</span>**: If <span class="math">\( x = 9889 \)</span>, the sum of its digits is <span class="math">\( 9 + 8 + 8 + 9 = 34 \)</span>.<br><br>By following these steps, you can find that <span class="math">\( x = 9889 \)</span> satisfies the conditions of the problem. Can you try this process and see if you arrive at the same conclusion?

                To find the possible values of <span class="math">\( x \)</span>, let's consider the 4-digit palindromes around the range we determined:<br><br>1. **Range for <span class="math">\( x \)</span>**: Since <span class="math">\( x + 212 \)</span> must be a 5-digit palindrome, <span class="math">\( x \)</span> must be at least 9789.<br><br>2. **Check palindromes**: The 4-digit palindromes around this range are 9779, 9889, 9999.<br><br>3. **Verify each palindrome**:<br>   - For <span class="math">\( x = 9779 \)</span>, <span class="math">\( x + 212 = 9991 \)</span> (not a palindrome).<br>   - For <span class="math">\( x = 9889 \)</span>, <span class="math">\( x + 212 = 10101 \)</span> (a palindrome).<br>   - For <span class="math">\( x = 9999 \)</span>, <span class="math">\( x + 212 = 10211 \)</span> (a palindrome).<br><br>Among these, <span class="math">\( x = 9889 \)</span> and <span class="math">\( x = 9999 \)</span> are valid because <span class="math">\( x + 212 \)</span> results in a 5-digit palindrome. However, <span class="math">\( x = 9889 \)</span> is the correct solution as it fits all conditions.<br><br>So, the possible values of <span class="math">\( x \)</span> are 9889 and 9999, but 9889 is the one that fits all conditions perfectly. Can you see why 9889 is the correct choice?

                Looking at the minimum and maximum values of <span class="math">\( x \)</span> helps narrow down the range and makes the problem more manageable. Here’s why:<br><br>1. **Minimum Value**: Since <span class="math">\( x + 212 \)</span> must be a 5-digit palindrome, the smallest possible value for <span class="math">\( x + 212 \)</span> is 10001. Therefore, <span class="math">\( x \geq 10001 - 212 = 9789 \)</span>.<br><br>2. **Maximum Value**: The largest 4-digit palindrome is 9999. So, <span class="math">\( x \leq 9999 \)</span>.<br><br>By focusing on this range, we can check the palindromes within it to see which one satisfies the condition that <span class="math">\( x + 212 \)</span> is also a palindrome.<br><br>**Alternative Approach**:<br>- **Direct Calculation**: Start with the smallest 5-digit palindrome (10001) and subtract 212 to get <span class="math">\( x \)</span>. Check if <span class="math">\( x \)</span> is a palindrome.<br>- **Pattern Recognition**: Recognize that the last two digits of <span class="math">\( x \)</span> must be 01 (since <span class="math">\( x + 212 \)</span> ends in 01 for it to be a palindrome).<br><br>For example:<br>- <span class="math">\( x = 9889 \)</span> gives <span class="math">\( x + 212 = 10101 \)</span>, which is a palindrome.<br>- <span class="math">\( x = 9999 \)</span> gives <span class="math">\( x + 212 = 10211 \)</span>, which is also a palindrome.<br><br>Both approaches help confirm that <span class="math">\( x = 9889 \)</span> is the correct solution.

                You're on the right track, but let's clarify a few points:<br><br>1. **Maximum Value of <span class="math">\( x \)</span>**: The largest 4-digit palindrome is indeed 9999. However, we need to check if <span class="math">\( x + 212 \)</span> is also a palindrome.<br>2. **Verification**:<br>   - If <span class="math">\( x = 9999 \)</span>, then <span class="math">\( x + 212 = 10211 \)</span>, which is a palindrome.<br>   - If <span class="math">\( x = 9889 \)</span>, then <span class="math">\( x + 212 = 10101 \)</span>, which is also a palindrome.<br><br>Both 9999 and 9889 are valid, but the problem asks for the sum of the digits of <span class="math">\( x \)</span>. For <span class="math">\( x = 9889 \)</span>, the sum of the digits is <span class="math">\( 9 + 8 + 8 + 9 = 34 \)</span>.<br><br>**First Digits of <span class="math">\( x \)</span>**:<br>- For <span class="math">\( x = 9889 \)</span>, the first two digits are 98.<br>- For <span class="math">\( x = 9999 \)</span>, the first two digits are 99.<br><br>Since the problem specifies that <span class="math">\( x + 212 \)</span> must be a 5-digit palindrome, and both 9889 and 9999 work, the sum of the digits of <span class="math">\( x \)</span> is 34 for <span class="math">\( x = 9889 \)</span>.<br><br>Can you see why 9889 is the correct choice based on the problem's conditions?

Both 9889 and 9999 are valid, but the sum of the digits of 9889 is 34, which matches the given solution.<br><br>So, the first digits of <span class="math">\( x \)</span> are 98 for <span class="math">\( x = 9889 \)</span>, and the sum of the digits is 34.

                Let's verify the possible values and their sums:<br><br>1. **For <span class="math">\( x = 9889 \)</span>**:<br>   - <span class="math">\( x + 212 = 9889 + 212 = 10101 \)</span> (a palindrome).<br>   - Sum of digits: <span class="math">\( 9 + 8 + 8 + 9 = 34 \)</span>.<br><br>2. **For <span class="math">\( x = 9999 \)</span>**:<br>   - <span class="math">\( x + 212 = 9999 + 212 = 10211 \)</span> (a palindrome).<br>   - Sum of digits: <span class="math">\( 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36 \)</span>.<br><br>Given the options 9889, 34, 32, and 3:<br><br>- The sum of the digits of 9889 is 34.<br>- The sum of the digits of 9999 is 36.<br><br>Since 32 is not the sum of the digits for either 9889 or 9999, it seems there might be a misunderstanding.

                Great! You're correct. The sum of the digits of <span class="math">\( x = 9889 \)</span> is indeed 34.<br><br>To summarize:<br>- <span class="math">\( x = 9889 \)</span> is a 4-digit palindrome.<br>- <span class="math">\( x + 212 = 9889 + 212 = 10101 \)</span>, which is a 5-digit palindrome.<br>- The sum of the digits of <span class="math">\( x \)</span> is <span class="math">\( 9 + 8 + 8 + 9 = 34 \)</span>.<br><br>Well done!

                The maximum possible value of x is 9999, which gives a maximum value for x + 212 as 10211. The minimum value of x + 212 is 10000 as it's a 5-digit number. We get that the first two digits of x must be 10, hence the last two must be 01 (since it's a palindrome). There are only 3 possible cases for x + 212: 10001, 10101, or 10201. Only 10101 gives a valid palindrome value for x, which is 9889, and the sum of its digits is 34.

                Exactly! You've got it right. Let's break it down step-by-step to confirm:<br><br>1. **Range of <span class="math">\( x \)</span>**:<br>   - The maximum possible value of <span class="math">\( x \)</span> is 9999.<br>   - Therefore, the maximum value of <span class="math">\( x + 212 \)</span> is <span class="math">\( 9999 + 212 = 10211 \)</span>.<br>   - The minimum value of <span class="math">\( x + 212 \)</span> is 10000, as it must be a 5-digit palindrome.<br><br>2. **Possible values of <span class="math">\( x + 212 \)</span>**:<br>   - The possible 5-digit palindromes are 10001, 10101, and 10201.<br><br>3. **Checking each case**:<br>   - For <span class="math">\( x + 212 = 10001 \)</span>:<br>     - <span class="math">\( x = 10001 - 212 = 9789 \)</span> (not a palindrome).<br>   - For <span class="math">\( x + 212 = 10101 \)</span>:<br>     - <span class="math">\( x = 10101 - 212 = 9889 \)</span> (a palindrome).<br>     - Sum of digits: <span class="math">\( 9 + 8 + 8 + 9 = 34 \)</span>.<br>   - For <span class="math">\( x + 212 = 10201 \)</span>:<br>     - <span class="math">\( x = 10201 - 212 = 9989 \)</span> (not a palindrome).<br><br>So, the only valid value for <span class="math">\( x \)</span> is 9889, and the sum of its digits is 34.<br><br>Great job on solving it!

                Of course! Here's a similar problem for you to practice:<br><br>**Problem**: A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. Let <span class="math">\( y \)</span> be a 3-digit palindrome number such that <span class="math">\( y + 121 \)</span> is a 4-digit palindrome number. What is the sum of the digits of <span class="math">\( y \)</span>?<br><br>**Hints**:<br>1. Identify the range of <span class="math">\( y \)</span> such that <span class="math">\( y + 121 \)</span> is a 4-digit palindrome.<br>2. Check the possible values of <span class="math">\( y \)</span> that satisfy the condition.<br>3. Calculate the sum of the digits of the valid <span class="math">\( y \)</span>.<br><br>Give it a try, and let me know if you need any hints along the way!
