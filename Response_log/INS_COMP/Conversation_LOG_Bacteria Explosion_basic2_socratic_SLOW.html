                Certainly! The problem describes a scenario where bacteria double in number with each proliferation. Starting with 1 bacterium, after each proliferation, the number of bacteria doubles. We need to find out how many bacteria there will be after 5 proliferations. Can you think about how the number changes with each step?

                Proliferation in this context means the process of the bacteria multiplying or increasing in number. Each time the bacteria proliferate, each bacterium divides into two. So, the number of bacteria doubles with each proliferation. How does this help you understand the pattern of growth?

                Don't worry! Everyone learns at their own pace, and it's okay to find things challenging at first. Let's take it one step at a time. Remember, the number of bacteria doubles each time:<br><br>1. Start with 1 bacterium.<br>2. After 1 proliferation: <span class="math">\(1 \times 2 = 2\)</span>.<br>3.

                I understand you're in a hurry, but let's try to solve it together quickly:<br><br>1. Start with 1 bacterium.<br>2. After 1 proliferation: <span class="math">\(1 \times 2 = 2\)</span>.<br>3. After 2 proliferations: <span class="math">\(2 \times 2 = 4\)</span>.<br>4.

                Yes, exactly! This problem is a great example of exponential growth. Each time the bacteria proliferate, the number doubles, which follows the pattern <span class="math">\(2^n\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is the number of proliferations. This rapid doubling is a key characteristic of exponential growth. Can you see how this pattern fits the problem?

                Certainly! Exponential growth occurs when the quantity increases by a constant factor at each step. In this case, the number of bacteria doubles with each proliferation. Mathematically, it can be represented as <span class="math">\(2^n\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is the number of steps (proliferations). <br><br>For example:<br>- After 1 proliferation: <span class="math">\(2^1 = 2\)</span><br>- After 2 proliferations: <span class="math">\(2^2 = 4\)</span><br>- After 3 proliferations: <span class="math">\(2^3 = 8\)</span><br><br>This rapid increase is characteristic of exponential growth. Does this help clarify the concept?

                Great question! To determine if a problem follows exponential growth, look for these key characteristics:<br><br>1. **Constant Multiplicative Factor**: The quantity increases by a constant factor at each step. In the bacteria problem, the number of bacteria doubles each time.<br>2. **Pattern of Doubling or Multiplying**: If the problem describes a scenario where the quantity multiplies by a fixed amount (like doubling, tripling, etc.) at each step, it likely follows exponential growth.<br>3. **Exponential Expression**: The growth can often be expressed as <span class="math">\(a \cdot b^n\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is the initial amount, <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is the growth factor, and <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is the number of steps.<br><br>Does this help you identify exponential growth in future problems?

                Yes, that's correct! After the fourth proliferation, there are 16 bacteria. Let's continue:<br><br>1. Start with 1 bacterium.<br>2.

                Not quite! After each proliferation, the number of bacteria doubles. So, after the fifth proliferation:<br><br>1. Start with 1 bacterium.<br>2.

                If there is 1 bacteria at the beginning, there should be 2 after the first division, 2+2 or 4 after the 2nd, and 2+2+2 or 6 after the 3rd, 2+2+2+2 or 8 after the 4th and 2+2+2+2+2  or 10 finally.

                You're close, but there's a small misunderstanding. The key is that the number of bacteria doubles at each step, not just adds 2. Let's break it down:<br><br>1.

                Great question! The key is understanding that each bacterium divides into two new bacteria, so the total number doubles at each step, not just increases by a fixed amount.<br><br>1. Start with 1 bacterium.<br>2. After the first proliferation: <span class="math">\(1 \times 2 = 2\)</span> bacteria.<br>3. After the second proliferation: <span class="math">\(2 \times 2 = 4\)</span> bacteria.<br>4. After the third proliferation: <span class="math">\(4 \times 2 = 8\)</span> bacteria.<br>5.

After the fifth proliferation: <span class="math">\(16 \times 2 = 32\)</span> bacteria.<br><br>Each bacterium splits into two, so the total number doubles. Summing the bacteria would not capture this exponential growth. Can you see why doubling is the correct approach?

                Shouldn't it be a geometric series? That is, the number of bacteria after the fifth proliferation will be 1+2+4+8+16+32 or 63?If there is 1 bacteria at the beginning, there should be (1+2) or 3 after the first division, (1+2+4) or 7 after the 2nd, and (1+2+4+8) or 15 after the 3rd, (1+2+4+8+16) or 31 after the 4th and (1+2+4+8+16+32) or 60 finally.

                You're on the right track with the idea of a geometric series, but the problem specifically asks for the number of bacteria after each proliferation, not the cumulative sum of all bacteria from the start.<br><br>Let's clarify:<br><br>1. Start with 1 bacterium.<br>2. After the first proliferation: <span class="math">\(1 \times 2 = 2\)</span> bacteria.<br>3. After the second proliferation: <span class="math">\(2 \times 2 = 4\)</span> bacteria.<br>4. After the third proliferation: <span class="math">\(4 \times 2 = 8\)</span> bacteria.<br>5. After the fourth proliferation: <span class="math">\(8 \times 2 = 16\)</span> bacteria.<br>6. After the fifth proliferation: <span class="math">\(16 \times 2 = 32\)</span> bacteria.<br><br>The number of bacteria at each step is the result of doubling the previous number, not summing all previous numbers. So, after the fifth proliferation, there are 32 bacteria.<br><br>If you sum all the bacteria from the start, you get a different series, but that's not what the problem is asking for. Can you see the difference now?

                As for every proliferation, the number doubles, it can be represented as 2^n (2 to the power n). Here n is the number of proliferations. For example, 2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8. This is an exponential growth process where the value grows quickly as the number of proliferations increases. So continuing this for 5 times, 2*2*2*2*2 or 2^5 is 32 which is the answer. Is this the explanation?
