                Understanding whether a problem follows exponential growth involves recognizing a few key characteristics:<br><br>1. **Constant Multiplicative Factor**: In exponential growth, the quantity increases by a constant factor at each step. For example, if the quantity doubles every step, triples every step, etc., it is growing exponentially.<br><br>2. **Pattern Recognition**: Look for a pattern where the quantity increases by multiplying by a constant factor rather than adding a constant amount. For example, in the bacteria problem, the number of bacteria doubles at each step.<br><br>3. **Mathematical Form**: Exponential growth can be represented mathematically as <span class="math">\(y = a \cdot b^n\)</span>, where:<br>   - <span class="math">\(y\)</span> is the quantity at step <span class="math">\(n\)</span>,<br>   - <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is the initial quantity,<br>   - <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is the constant factor by which the quantity increases at each step,<br>   - <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is the number of steps.<br><br>Let's apply this to the bacteria problem:<br><br>- **Initial Condition**: Start with 1 bacterium (<span class="math">\(a = 1\)</span>).<br>- **Constant Factor**: The number of bacteria doubles at each step (<span class="math">\(b = 2\)</span>).<br>- **Number of Steps**: <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is the number of proliferations.<br><br>So, the formula for the

                As for every proliferation, the number doubles, it can be represented as 2^n (2 to the power n). Here n is the number of proliferations. For example, 2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8. This is an exponential growth process where the value grows quickly as the number of proliferations increases. So continuing this for 5 times, 2*2*2*2*2 or 2^5 is 32 which is the answer.

If the initial population of bacteria is 3, how many bacteria will there be after 4 proliferations?<br><br>**Solution Steps:**<br><br>1. **Initial Condition**: Start with 3 bacteria.<br>2. **First Proliferation**: Each of the 3 bacteria divides into 2, resulting in <span class="math">\(3 \times 2 = 6\)</span> bacteria.<br>3. **Second Proliferation**: Each of the 6 bacteria divides into 2, resulting in <span class="math">\(6 \times 2 = 12\)</span> bacteria.<br>4. **Third Proliferation**: Each of the 12 bacteria divides into 2, resulting in <span class="math">\(12 \times 2 = 24\)</span> bacteria.<br>5. **Fourth Proliferation**: Each of the 24 bacteria divides into 2, resulting in <span class="math">\(24 \times 2 = 48\)</span> bacteria.<br><br>Mathematically, the number of bacteria after <span class="math">\( n \)</span> proliferations can be represented as \( 3 \times
