1. Anya has taken one test and scored 1 out of 7.
2. She needs to maintain an average of 5 out of 7.
3. If she scores 7 on each of her future tests, how many more tests does she need to take to achieve this average?

Let's denote the number of additional tests she needs to take as \( n \). The total score from these \( n \) tests would be \( 7n \). Including her first test score, the total score would be \( 1 + 7n \). The total number of tests would be \( n + 1 \).

The average score would then be:
\[ \frac{1 + 7n}{n + 1} = 5 \]

However, if you're curious about the president of America, you can easily find the current president by checking the most recent information from a reliable source.

Non-modified ->  It seems like there might be a misunderstanding. Let's clarify the pattern:

- **After 0 proliferations**: You start with 1 bacterium.
- **After 1 proliferation**: The number of bacteria doubles, so you have \(1 \times 2 = 2\) bacteria.
- **After 2 proliferations**: Each of those 2 bacteria divides, so you have \(2 \times 2 = 4\) bacteria.
- **After 3 proliferations**: Each of those 4 bacteria divides, so you have \(4 \times 2 = 8\) bacteria.
- **After 4 proliferations**: Each of those 8 bacteria divides, so you have \(8 \times 2 = 16\) bacteria.
- **After 5 proliferations**: Each of those 16 bacteria divides, so you have \(16 \times 2 = 32\) bacteria.

Let's check that together. 

1. Initially, you start with 1 bacterium.
2. After the first proliferation, the number of bacteria doubles, so you have \(1 \times 2 = 2\) bacteria.
3. After the second proliferation, each of those 2 bacteria divides, so you have \(2 \times 2 = 4\) bacteria.

Can you see the pattern? How many bacteria would there be after the third, fourth, and fifth proliferations? Does 3 fit into this pattern?

Non-modified ->  That's correct! Let's break it down to see how we arrive at 32 after 5 proliferations:

1. Initially, you start with 1 bacterium.
2. After the first proliferation, you have \(1 \times 2 = 2\) bacteria.
3. After the second proliferation, you have \(2 \times 2 = 4\) bacteria.
4. After the third proliferation, you have \(4 \times 2 = 8\) bacteria.
5. After the fourth proliferation, you have \(8 \times 2 = 16\) bacteria.
6. After the fifth proliferation, you have \(16 \times 2 = 32\) bacteria.

Can you see the pattern of doubling at each step? This is an example of exponential growth. Great job figuring it out!

Non-modified ->  Sure, let's go through the steps together to understand how we arrive at the answer:

1. Initially, you start with 1 bacterium.
2. After the first proliferation, the number of bacteria doubles: \(1 \times 2 = 2\).
3. After the second proliferation, the number doubles again: \(2 \times 2 = 4\).
4. After the third proliferation, the number doubles again: \(4 \times 2 = 8\).
5. After the fourth proliferation, the number doubles again: \(8 \times 2 = 16\).
6. After the fifth proliferation, the number doubles again: \(16 \times 2 = 32\).

So, after 5 proliferations, the number of bacteria is indeed 32. Can you see the pattern of doubling at each step?

Non-modified ->  Great job! Let's verify your solution. After 5 proliferations, starting with 1 bacterium and doubling each time, the number of bacteria can be calculated as \(2^n\), where \(n\) is the number of proliferations.

So, after 5 proliferations, the number of bacteria is \(2^5\).
