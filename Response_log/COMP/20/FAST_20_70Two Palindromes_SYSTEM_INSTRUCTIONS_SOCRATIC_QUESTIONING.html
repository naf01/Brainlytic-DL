                The maximum possible value of x is 9999, which gives a maximum value for x + 212 as 10211. The minimum value of x + 212 is 10000 as it's a 5-digit number. We get that the first two digits of x must be 10, hence the last two must be 01 (since it's a palindrome). There are only 3 possible cases for x + 212: 10001, 10101, or 10201. Only 10101 gives a valid palindrome value for x, which is 9889, and the sum of its digits is 34.

                That's a detailed analysis! Let's break down your reasoning a bit more to ensure everything is clear and logically sound.

1. Why did you start with the maximum possible value of \( x \) as 9999?
2. How did you determine that the first two digits of \( x \) must be 10?
3. Why did you conclude that the last two digits of \( x \) must be 01?
4. Can you explain why only 10101 gives a valid palindrome value for \( x \)?
5. How did you verify that 9889 is indeed a palindrome and that the sum of its digits is 34?

Can you walk through these steps and justify each one?
