                Of course! The problem involves a 4-digit palindrome number \( x \). When you add 212 to \( x \), the result is a 5-digit palindrome number. Your task is to find the sum of the digits of \( x \).

To help us solve this, let's consider the following:
1. What is the smallest 4-digit palindrome?
2. What is the largest 4-digit palindrome?
3. Given that \( x + 212 \) is a 5-digit palindrome, what can you infer about the range of \( x \)?

                Certainly! Let's approach this problem by considering the constraints and properties of palindromes.

1. **Range of \( x \)**: Since \( x \) is a 4-digit number and \( x + 212 \) is a 5-digit palindrome, the smallest possible value for \( x + 212 \) is 10000. Therefore, the smallest possible value for \( x \) is \( 10000 - 212 = 9788 \). The largest possible value for \( x \) is 9999.

2. **Properties of \( x \)**: Since \( x \) is a 4-digit palindrome, it can be written in the form \( abba \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are digits. This means \( x = 1001a + 110b \).

3. **Form of \( x + 212 \)**: The number \( x + 212 \) must be a 5-digit palindrome. The smallest 5-digit palindrome is 10001, and the largest is 9999

                Don't worry! Everyone can understand these concepts with the right guidance and practice. Let's break it down into simpler steps and take it one step at a time.

1. **Understanding Palindromes**: A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. For example, 1221 is a palindrome.
   
2. **Range of \( x \)**: Since \( x \) is a 4-digit number and \( x + 212 \) is a 5-digit palindrome, the smallest possible value for \( x + 212 \) is 10000. Therefore, the smallest possible value for \( x \) is \( 10000 - 212 = 9788 \). The largest possible value for \( x \) is 9999.

3. **Form of \( x \)**: Since \( x \) is a 4-digit palindrome, it can be written as \( abba \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are digits. For example, if \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \), then \( x = 1221 \

                Absolutely, let's try a different approach to make it clearer. We'll break down the problem step by step and use simpler language.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have a 4-digit palindrome number \( x \).
   - When we add 212 to \( x \), the result is a 5-digit palindrome number.

2. **Range of \( x \)**:
   - The smallest 5-digit palindrome is 10001.
   - Therefore, the smallest possible value for \( x \) is \( 10001 - 212 = 9789 \).
   - The largest 4-digit palindrome is 9999.

3. **Properties of Palindromes**:
   - A 4-digit palindrome has the form \( abba \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are digits.
   - For example, if \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \), then \( x = 1221 \).

4. **Finding \( x \)**:
   - We need to find a 4-digit palindrome \( x \) such that \( x + 2

                I understand that you're in a hurry, but my goal is to help you understand the process and learn how to solve similar problems on your own. Let's quickly go through the steps to find the solution:

1. **Range of \( x \)**:
   - The smallest 5-digit palindrome is 10001.
   - Therefore, the smallest possible value for \( x \) is \( 10001 - 212 = 9789 \).
   - The largest 4-digit palindrome is 9999.

2. **Possible Values for \( x + 212 \)**:
   - The possible 5-digit palindromes are 10001, 10101, 10201, etc.
   - We need to check which of these, when 212 is subtracted, results in a 4-digit palindrome.

3. **Checking Values**:
   - If \( x + 212 = 10001 \), then \( x = 10001 - 212 = 9789 \) (not a palindrome).

                Can you provide some other examples of palindromes? Are they always of even length?

            <div class='message assistant'>
                <strong>Assistant(primary):</strong><br>
                Certainly! Palindromes can be of any length, not just even lengths. Here are some examples of palindromes:

- **Single digit**: 1, 2, 3, etc.
- **Two digits**: 11, 22, 33, etc.
- **Three digits**: 121, 343, 565, etc.
- **Four digits**: 1221, 3443, 5665, etc.
- **Five digits**: 12321, 34543, 56765, etc.
- **Six digits**: 123321, 345543, 567765, etc.

Notice that palindromes can be of any length, and they read the same backward as forward.

Now, let's apply this understanding to the problem at hand. We need to find a 4-digit palindrome \( x \) such that \( x + 212 \) is a 5-digit palindrome. Can you think about the possible values of \( x \) based on the range we

            <div class='message assistant'>
                <strong>Assistant(primary):</strong><br>
                That's a great question! The key here is to understand that the problem specifically states that \( x \) is a 4-digit palindrome. This is a given condition, not something we need to prove. Our task is to find a 4-digit palindrome \( x \) such that when 212 is added to it, the result is a 5-digit palindrome.

Let's break it down further:

1. **Given Condition**: \( x \) is a 4-digit palindrome.
2. **Objective**: Find \( x \) such that \( x + 212 \) is a 5-digit palindrome.

To solve this, we need to check which 4-digit palindromes, when 212 is added, result in a 5-digit palindrome. Let's consider the possible 5-digit palindromes and work backwards:

- The smallest 5-digit palindrome is 10001.
- If \( x + 212 = 10001 \), then \( x = 10001 - 212 = 9789 \) (not a palindrome).
- The next 5-digit palindrome is 10

A 4-digit palindrome has the form \( abba \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are digits. This means the first and last digits are the same, and the second and third digits are the same.

Let's break it down:

   - For example, if \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \), then \( x = 1221 \).

2. **Checking Possible Values**:

                If the first two digits are 10, then the last two should be 01. We can place any of the 10 values from 0-9 and it will still be a palindrome right?

                That's a good observation, but let's clarify the structure and constraints of the problem:

1. **Form of \( x \)**:
   - \( x \) is a 4-digit palindrome, so it has the form \( abba \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are digits.
   - For example, if \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \), then \( x = 1221 \).

2. **Range of \( x \)**:
   - The smallest 5-digit palindrome is 10001. Therefore, the smallest possible value for \( x \) is \( 10001 - 212 = 9789 \).
   - The largest 4-digit palindrome is 9999.

3. **Checking Possible Values**:
   - We need to find a 4-digit palindrome \( x \) such that \( x + 212 \) is a 5-digit palindrome.
   - If \( x + 212 = 10101 \), then \( x = 10101 - 212 = 9889

            <div class='message user'>
                <strong>Student:</strong><br>
                Then shouldn’t there be 10 answers of the sum as there are 10 possible values of x+212, implying 10 possible values of x?

                That's an interesting thought, but let's carefully consider the constraints and the specific conditions of the problem:

1. **Form of \( x \)**:
   - \( x \) is a 4-digit palindrome, so it has the form \( abba \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are digits.
   - For example, if \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \), then \( x = 1221 \).

2. **Range of \( x \)**:
   - The smallest 5-digit palindrome is 10001. Therefore, the smallest possible value for \( x \) is \( 10001 - 212 = 9789 \).
   - The largest 4-digit palindrome is 9999.

3. **Checking Possible Values**:
   - We need to find a 4-digit palindrome \( x \) such that \( x + 212 \) is a 5-digit palindrome.
   - The possible 5-digit palindromes are 10001, 10101, 10201, etc.

                Great question! Let's consider why we might not need to check all possible 5-digit palindromes like 10301, 10401, etc.

   - The largest 4-digit palindrome is 9999.

2. **Checking Possible Values**:
   - We need to find a 4-digit palindrome \( x \) such that \( x + 212 \) is a 5-digit palindrome.
   - Let's check the possible 5-digit palindromes starting from the smallest:

     - If \( x + 212 = 10001 \), then \( x = 10001 - 212 = 9789 \) (not a palindrome).
     - If \( x + 212 = 10101 \), then \( x = 10101 -

                Let's verify the possible values and the sum of the digits for \( x \):

1. **Checking \( x = 9889 \)**:
   - \( x + 212 = 9889 + 212 = 10101 \), which is a 5-digit palindrome.
   - The sum of the digits of \( x = 9889 \) is \( 9 + 8 + 8 + 9 = 34 \).

2. **Possible Values**:
   - The possible values you provided are 9889, 34, 32, and 3.

Given that \( x = 9889 \) is a valid 4-digit palindrome and \( x + 212 = 10101 \) is a 5-digit palindrome, the sum of the digits of \( x \) is \( 34 \).

So, the correct answer among the provided options is \( 34 \).

                The maximum possible value of x is 9999, which gives a maximum value for x + 212 as 10211. The minimum value of x + 212 is 10000 as it's a 5-digit number. We get that the first two digits of x must be 10, hence the last two must be 01 (since it's a palindrome). There are only 3 possible cases for x + 212: 10001, 10101, or 10201. Only 10101 gives a valid palindrome value for x, which is 9889, and the sum of its digits is 34.

                Of course! Here's a similar problem for you to practice:

**Problem Name: Two Palindromes Variation**

**Subject Area: Math**
**Subtopic: Number Theory**

**Problem Statement:**
A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. For example, 363, 4224, and 21512 are palindromes. Let \( y \) be a 3-digit palindrome number such that \( y + 121 \) is a 4-digit palindrome number. What is the sum of the digits of \( y \)?

**Hints:**
- Analyze the possible values of \( y \) that, when increased by 121, still form a palindrome.
- Consider the range of \( y \) and the resulting 4-digit palindrome.

**Solution:**
Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Range of \( y \)**:
   - The smallest 4-digit palindrome is 10001. Therefore, the smallest possible value for \( y \) is \( 1000 - 121 = 879 \).
   - The largest 3-digit palindrome is
