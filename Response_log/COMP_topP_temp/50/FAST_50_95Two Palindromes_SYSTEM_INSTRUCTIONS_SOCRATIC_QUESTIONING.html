                The maximum possible value of x is 9999, which gives a maximum value for x + 212 as 10211. The minimum value of x + 212 is 10000 as it's a 5-digit number. We get that the first two digits of x must be 10, hence the last two must be 01 (since it's a palindrome). There are only 3 possible cases for x + 212: 10001, 10101, or 10201. Only 10101 gives a valid palindrome value for x, which is 9889, and the sum of its digits is 34.

                That's a detailed analysis! Let's break down your reasoning a bit more to ensure everything is clear and logically sound.

1. You mentioned that the maximum possible value of \( x \) is 9999, leading to \( x + 212 = 10211 \). Why did you choose 9999 as the maximum value for \( x \)?

2. You also noted that the minimum value of \( x + 212 \) is 10000 because it must be a 5-digit number. How did you determine that \( x + 212 \) must be a 5-digit number?

3. You concluded that the first two digits of \( x \) must be 10 and the last two must be 01. Can you explain why this is the case? How does this relate to the possible values of \( x + 212 \)?

4. You identified three possible cases for \( x + 212 \): 10001, 10101, or 10201. Why did you choose these specific values? How did you determine that only 1
