                Of course! The problem involves a 4-digit palindrome number \( x \). When you add 212 to \( x \), the result is a 5-digit palindrome number. Your task is to find the sum of the digits of \( x \).

To help us solve this, let's consider the following:
1. What is the smallest 4-digit palindrome?
2. What is the largest 4-digit palindrome?
3. Given that \( x + 212 \) is a 5-digit palindrome, what can you infer about the range of \( x \)?

                Certainly! Let's approach this problem by considering the constraints and properties of palindromes.

1. **Range of \( x \)**: Since \( x \) is a 4-digit number and \( x + 212 \) is a 5-digit palindrome, the smallest possible value for \( x + 212 \) is 10000. Therefore, the smallest possible value for \( x \) is \( 10000 - 212 = 9788 \). The largest possible value for \( x \) is 9999.

2. **Properties of \( x \)**: Since \( x \) is a 4-digit palindrome, it can be written in the form \( abba \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are digits. This means \( x = 1001a + 110b \).

3. **Form of \( x + 212 \)**: The number \( x + 212 \) must be a 5-digit palindrome. The smallest 5-digit palindrome is 10001, and the largest is 9999

                Don't worry! Everyone can understand these concepts with the right guidance and practice. Let's break it down into simpler steps and take it one step at a time.

1. **Understanding Palindromes**: A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. For example, 1221 is a palindrome.
   
2. **Range of \( x \)**: Since \( x \) is a 4-digit number and \( x + 212 \) is a 5-digit palindrome, the smallest possible value for \( x + 212 \) is 10000. Therefore, the smallest possible value for \( x \) is \( 10000 - 212 = 9788 \). The largest possible value for \( x \) is 9999.

3. **Form of \( x \)**: Since \( x \) is a 4-digit palindrome, it can be written as \( abba \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are digits. For example, if \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \), then \( x = 1221 \

                Absolutely, let's try a different approach to make it clearer. We'll break down the problem step by step and use simpler language.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have a 4-digit palindrome number \( x \).
   - When we add 212 to \( x \), the result is a 5-digit palindrome number.

2. **Range of \( x \)**:
   - The smallest 5-digit palindrome is 10001.
   - Therefore, the smallest possible value for \( x \) is \( 10001 - 212 = 9789 \).
   - The largest 4-digit palindrome is 9999.

3. **Properties of Palindromes**:
   - A 4-digit palindrome has the form \( abba \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are digits.
   - For example, if \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \), then \( x = 1221 \).

4. **Finding \( x \)**:
   - We need to find a 4-digit palindrome \( x \) such that \( x + 2

                I understand that you're in a hurry, but my goal is to help you understand the process and learn how to solve similar problems on your own. Let's quickly go through the steps to find the solution:

1. **Range of \( x \)**:
   - The smallest 5-digit palindrome is 10001.
   - Therefore, the smallest possible value for \( x \) is \( 10001 - 212 = 9789 \).
   - The largest 4-digit palindrome is 9999.

2. **Possible Values for \( x + 212 \)**:
   - The possible 5-digit palindromes are 10001, 10101, 10201, etc.
   - We need to check which of these, when 212 is subtracted, results in a 4-digit palindrome.

3. **Checking Values**:
   - If \( x + 212 = 10001 \), then \( x = 10001 - 212 = 9789 \) (not a palindrome).

            <div class='message assistant'>
                <strong>Assistant(primary):</strong><br>
                Certainly! Palindromes can be of any length, not just even lengths. Here are some examples of palindromes:

- **Single digit**: 1, 2, 3, etc.
- **Two digits**: 11, 22, 33, etc.
- **Three digits**: 121, 343, 565, etc.
- **Four digits**: 1221, 3443, 5665, etc.
- **Five digits**: 12321, 34543, 56765, etc.
- **Six digits**: 123321, 345543, 567765, etc.

Notice that palindromes can be of any length, whether even or odd. The key property is that they read the same backward as forward.

Given this, can you think about how the properties of palindromes might help us solve the problem of finding \( x \) such that \( x + 212 \) is a 5-digit palindrome?

                <strong>Assistant(primary):</strong><br>
                That's a great question! The key point here is that \( x \) is given to be a 4-digit palindrome, and we need to find such an \( x \) that when 212 is added to it, the result is a 5-digit palindrome.

Let's break it down:

1. **Given**: \( x \) is a 4-digit palindrome.
2. **Condition**: \( x + 212 \) is a 5-digit palindrome.

To solve this, we need to find a 4-digit palindrome \( x \) such that when 212 is added to it, the result is a 5-digit palindrome. Let's consider the possible 5-digit palindromes and work backwards to find \( x \).

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Identify Possible 5-Digit Palindromes**:
   - The smallest 5-digit palindrome is 10001.
   - The next ones are 10101, 10201, etc.

2. **Check Each Palindrome**:

                Great question! Let's work through the steps to find the value of \( x \).

1. **Identify Possible 5-Digit Palindromes**:
   - The smallest 5-digit palindrome is 10001.
   - The next ones are 10101, 10201, etc.

2. **Check Each Palindrome**:
   - For each 5-digit palindrome \( y \), calculate \( x = y - 212 \).
   - Check if \( x \) is a 4-digit palindrome.

Let's start with the smallest 5-digit palindrome, 10001:

- If \( y = 10001 \), then \( x = 10001 - 212 = 9789 \).
- Check if 9789 is a palindrome: It is not (9789 ≠ 9879).

Next, let's try the next 5-digit palindrome, 10101:

- If \( y = 10101 \), then \( x = 10101 - 212 =

                Let's continue from where we left off. We need to find the value of \( x \) such that \( x + 212 \) is a 5-digit palindrome and \( x \) is a 4-digit palindrome.

1. **Identify Possible 5-Digit Palindromes**:
   - The smallest 5-digit palindrome is 10001.
   - The next ones are 10101, 10201, etc.

2. **Check Each Palindrome**:
   - For each 5-digit palindrome \( y \), calculate \( x = y - 212 \).
   - Check if \( x \) is a 4-digit palindrome.

Let's try the next 5-digit palindrome, 10101:

- If \( y = 10101 \), then \( x = 10101 - 212 = 9889 \).
- Check if 9889 is a palindrome: It is (9889 reads the same backward).

Since 9889 is a 4-digit palindrome, we have found our \( x \).

1. **Range of \( x \)**:
   - The smallest 5-digit palindrome is 10001.
   - Therefore, the smallest possible value for \( x \) is \( 10001 - 212 = 9789 \).
   - The largest 4-digit palindrome is 9999.

2. **Checking Possible 5-Digit Palindromes**:
   - We can list out the possible 5-digit palindromes and check if subtracting 212 from them results in a 4-digit palindrome.
   - For example, if \( y = 10101 \), then \( x = 10101 - 212 = 9889 \).
   - Check if 9889 is a palindrome: It is (9889 reads the same backward).

   - Check if 9889 is a palindrome: It is (9889 reads the same backward).

   - Check if 9889 is a palindrome: It is (9889 reads the same backward).

Given this, let's verify the first digits of \( x \):

                Let's clarify the structure of the 4-digit palindrome \( x \) and how the digits relate to each other.

1. **Form of \( x \)**:
   - A 4-digit palindrome \( x \) has the form \( abba \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are digits.
   - For \( x \) to be a palindrome, the first digit must match the last digit, and the second digit must match the third digit.

2. **Given Condition**:
   - We need \( x + 212 \) to be a 5-digit palindrome.
   - The smallest 5-digit palindrome is 10001, so the smallest possible value for \( x \) is \( 10001 - 212 = 9789 \).

3. **Checking Possible Values**:
   - Let's consider the 5-digit palindromes and check if subtracting 212 results in a 4-digit palindrome.
   - For example, if \( y = 10101 \), then \( x = 10101 - 212 = 9889 \).

            <div class='message user'>
                <strong>Student:</strong><br>
                Then shouldn’t there be 10 answers of the sum as there are 10 possible values of x+212, implying 10 possible values of x?

                <strong>Assistant(primary):</strong><br>
                Let's carefully analyze the problem to understand why there is only one valid solution for \( x \).

1. **Form of \( x \)**:
   - A 4-digit palindrome \( x \) has the form \( abba \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are digits.
   - For \( x \) to be a palindrome, the first digit must match the last digit, and the second digit must match the third digit.

2. **Given Condition**:
   - We need \( x + 212 \) to be a 5-digit palindrome.
   - The smallest 5-digit palindrome is 10001, so the smallest possible value for \( x \) is \( 10001 - 212 = 9789 \).

3. **Checking Possible 5-Digit Palindromes**:
   - We need to check which 5-digit palindromes, when 212 is subtracted, result in a 4-digit palindrome.
   - Let's consider the possible 5-digit palindromes: 10001, 10101, 10201

            <div class='message assistant'>
                <strong>Assistant(primary):</strong><br>
                Great question! Let's consider why we focus on the specific 5-digit palindromes and why 10301, 10401, and so on, might not be relevant.

1. **Range of \( x \)**:
   - The smallest 5-digit palindrome is 10001.
   - Therefore, the smallest possible value for \( x \) is \( 10001 - 212 = 9789 \).
   - The largest 4-digit palindrome is 9999.

2. **Checking Possible 5-Digit Palindromes**:
   - We need to find a 5-digit palindrome \( y \) such that \( y - 212 \) is a 4-digit palindrome.
   - For example, if \( y = 10101 \), then \( x = 10101 - 212 = 9889 \).
   - Check if 9889 is a palindrome: It is (9889 reads the same backward).

3. **Form of \( x \)**:

                Great! Let's verify that the solution \( x = 9889 \) is correct and that the sum of its digits is indeed 34.

1. **Form of \( x \)**:
   - A 4-digit palindrome \( x \) has the form \( abba \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are digits.

                The maximum possible value of x is 9999, which gives a maximum value for x + 212 as 10211. The minimum value of x + 212 is 10000 as it's a 5-digit number. We get that the first two digits of x must be 10, hence the last two must be 01 (since it's a palindrome). There are only 3 possible cases for x + 212: 10001, 10101, or 10201. Only 10101 gives a valid palindrome value for x, which is 9889, and the sum of its digits is 34.

1. **Range of \( x \)**:
   - The maximum possible value of \( x \) is 9999.

2. **Possible Values for \( x + 212 \)**:
   - The possible 5-digit palindromes are 10001, 10101, and 10201.

3. **Checking Each Case**:
   - If \( x + 212 = 10001 \), then \( x = 10001 - 212 = 9789 \). This is not a palindrome.
   - If \( x + 212 = 10101 \), then \( x = 101

**Problem Name: Two Palindromes Variation**

**Subject Area: Math**
**Subtopic: Number Theory**

**Problem Statement:**
A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. Given that \( x \) is a 4-digit palindrome and \( x + 121 \) is a 5-digit palindrome, find the sum of the digits of \( x \).

**Hints:**
- Analyze the possible values of \( x \) that, when increased by 121, still form a palindrome.
- Consider the range of \( x \) and the resulting 5-digit palindromes.

**Solution:**
Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Range of \( x \)**:
   - The smallest 5-digit palindrome is 10001.
   - Therefore, the smallest possible value for \( x \) is \( 10001 - 121 = 9880 \).
   - The largest 4-digit palindrome is 9999.
