Student: Can you explain the problem?
Assistant: Sure! The problem describes a situation where bacteria double in number with each proliferation. Starting with 1 bacterium, you need to find out how many bacteria there will be after 5 proliferations. Think about how the number changes with each step. What pattern do you notice?
Student: Can you explain the problem?
Assistant: Of course! You start with 1 bacterium. With each proliferation, the number of bacteria doubles. So after the first proliferation, you have 2 bacteria. After the second, you have 4. Can you see the pattern? How many bacteria would there be after 5 proliferations? Think about how the number changes each time.
Student: Hmm... I think it would be 16?
Assistant: Let's think through it step-by-step. After the first proliferation, you have 2 bacteria. After the second, you have 4. After the third, you have 8. Can you continue this pattern to the fifth proliferation? What do you notice about the numbers?
Student: IS the answer 2?
Assistant: Not quite. Remember, the number of bacteria doubles with each proliferation. After the first proliferation, you have 2 bacteria. Keep doubling this number for each subsequent proliferation. How many times have you doubled the number so far? Keep going until you reach the fifth proliferation.
Student: Hmm... I'm not sure...
Assistant: That's okay! Let's break it down. After the first proliferation, you have 2 bacteria. After the second, you double that to get 4. After the third, you double 4 to get 8. Continue this pattern for two more steps. What do you get after the fifth proliferation? Keep doubling the number each time.
Student: Oh, I see! So it's like an exponential growth!
Assistant: Exactly! You've got it. The number of bacteria grows exponentially, doubling with each proliferation. This pattern follows the rule of 2 raised to the power of the number of proliferations. Great observation! Can you now calculate the number of bacteria after 5 proliferations using this pattern?
Student: Thanks
Assistant: You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask. Keep up the good work!
Student: but i still haven't found the answer. Can you please tell me the answer?
Assistant: Of course! After 5 proliferations, starting with 1 bacterium, the number of bacteria will be \(2^5\), which equals 32. Remember, each proliferation doubles the number of bacteria. Great job on recognizing the exponential growth pattern! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.
