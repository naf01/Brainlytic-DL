She found that bacteria proliferated into two daughter cells. That is, 1 bacteria becomes 2 by dividing itself, then each of them divides into two more, making a total of 4, and so on. What is the number of produced bacteria after 5 proliferations, if initially the number of bacteria was 1?\\nHints: Think about how the number of bacteria doubles each time. What does this tell you about the pattern?\\nSolution: 32\\nExplanation: As for every proliferation, the number doubles, it can be represented as 2^n (2 to the power n). Here n is the number of proliferations. For example, 2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8. This is an example of an exponential growth process where the value grows quickly as the number of proliferations increases.\\n\\nUser: Can you explain the problem?\", prompt_token_ids=[2320, 25, 1446, 525, 264, 3070, 665, 11829, 17847, 334, 879, 3070, 23448, 288, 334, 4143, 304, 8660, 6888, 323, 19819, 18940, 1526, 3070, 9520, 14319, 29208, 30643, 334, 323, 3070, 60565, 9838, 85, 10746, 4755, 334, 2293, 334, 36493, 334, 7086, 2118, 11253, 476, 10476, 1105, 3070, 1528, 266, 334, 13, 1446, 1265, 3070, 6627, 398, 334, 2736, 697, 3476, 438, 264, 12629, 17847, 879, 3070, 32122, 334, 8788, 1246, 311, 11625, 279, 3491, 438, 498, 686, 387, 2661, 279, 6291, 323, 16148, 311, 1191, 448, 11, 3070, 2982, 537, 334, 6923, 4755, 476, 12239, 389, 17522, 315, 279, 4143, 13, 19434, 14507, 3070, 6658, 22438, 16, 15, 15, 11211, 701, 4583, 11, 323, 22570, 97219, 2677, 69717, 311, 279, 5458, 594, 3070, 7995, 10070, 334, 13, 3070, 49471, 26310, 334, 862, 3070, 3231, 3405, 334, 916, 3267, 2266, 1393, 12831, 4867, 14507, 13, 5443, 3070, 30487, 71278, 97219, 22573, 3070, 564, 10748, 323, 57323, 334, 3118, 389, 279, 3070, 63425, 3491, 3565, 334, 13, 3070, 5865, 4183, 334, 6923, 5458, 14507, 11, 2924, 3070, 70, 579, 652, 812, 11, 2038, 11, 476, 4718, 334, 13, 3070, 5865, 4183, 334, 1077, 279, 4143, 1414, 892, 4226, 374, 4396, 421, 807, 1430, 678, 3204, 11253, 304, 264, 64098, 5344, 11153, 2041, 8241, 19819, 40841, 11, 3070, 11683, 334, 21937, 7683, 804, 13, 334, 1808, 65962, 334, 279, 16829, 42011, 25, 1416, 264, 5458, 27870, 11, 3410, 3070, 7422, 261, 30643, 334, 13, 1416, 807, 11996, 6157, 11, 8645, 1105, 448, 3070, 64, 19117, 3405, 334, 320, 68, 1302, 2572, 364, 6713, 498, 11625, 432, 2441, 1616, 30, 1823, 86377, 458, 3070, 37540, 11, 32930, 5486, 334, 320, 68, 1302, 2572, 421, 279, 5458, 17064, 364, 3872, 220, 19, 9, 19, 220, 16, 21, 49634, 279, 2033, 1265, 387, 353, 6, 9454, 11, 220, 19, 17568, 19, 374, 220, 16, 21, 0, 8325, 2814, 3159, 12314, 448, 902, 84966, 568, 11112, 279, 3070, 58972, 1890, 12223, 15571, 334, 11221, 12392, 3685, 13, 3070, 19524, 311, 1795, 1493, 11, 323, 498, 4700, 387, 13895, 0, 1019, 10253, 3070, 66, 50449, 56150, 14995, 334, 323, 3070, 22386, 36512, 40864, 1824, 334, 311, 8474, 6888, 6832, 13444, 13, 3070, 35348, 66963, 10751, 60040, 4396, 11253, 1172, 979, 16148, 374, 3897, 320, 68, 1302, 2572, 364, 9454, 11, 220, 24, 374, 4396, 0, 8325, 2814, 13, 1823, 3070, 74933, 66963, 20678, 11464, 30643, 2041, 30620, 11253, 320, 68, 1302, 2572, 364, 38687, 911, 279, 2846, 6704, 3343, 1112, 1823, 3070, 641, 1235, 287, 66963, 7139, 4143, 8841, 279, 1290, 5486, 320, 68, 1302, 2572, 364, 21453, 2097, 5503, 1156, 13, 1823, 3070, 43953, 2056, 66963, 30081, 1437, 18940, 320, 68, 1302, 2572, 364, 57251, 6711, 505, 2700, 30, 2691, 1105, 13, 1823, 3070, 1712, 287, 66963, 32305, 69915, 32711, 3019, 553, 3019, 320, 68, 1302, 2572, 364, 5338, 11, 16417, 1112, 1823, 3070, 14582, 287, 66963, 5443, 1787, 83075, 50932, 320, 68, 1302, 2572, 364, 3838, 8282, 15491, 9606, 419, 19419, 30, 1823, 3070, 26317, 36512, 40864, 1824, 66963, 10751, 60040, 98741, 320, 68, 1302, 2572, 364, 2610, 2299, 389, 279, 1290, 3754, 0, 4567, 21694, 20643, 320, 68, 1302, 2572, 364, 44, 380, 2050, 1492, 601, 3960, 3159, 701, 323, 29987, 20031, 320, 68, 1302, 2572, 364, 840, 20772, 697, 32711, 311, 264, 536, 18052, 13, 1823, 29279, 4143, 22040, 3070, 84739, 304, 3491, 98146, 334, 1526, 32930, 18821, 11, 3070, 36493, 2118, 11253, 13, 1019, 2320, 25, 22079, 3988, 25, 425, 77752, 92686, 198, 13019, 3082, 25, 4149, 198, 3136, 16411, 25, 5624, 11131, 198, 31198, 21756, 25, 425, 896, 6586, 572, 20956, 17398, 30126, 320, 64, 23275, 2070, 429, 7822, 79627, 568, 2932, 1730, 429, 23157, 41936, 657, 1119, 1378, 9803, 7761, 13, 2938, 374, 11, 220, 16, 23157, 9044, 220, 17, 553, 49702, 5086, 11, 1221, 1817, 315, 1105, 64828, 1119, 1378, 803, 11, 3259, 264, 2790, 315, 220, 19, 11, 323, 773, 389, 13, 3555, 374, 279, 1372, 315, 8947, 23157, 1283, 220, 20, 41936, 804, 11, 421, 15102, 279, 1372, 315, 23157, 572, 220, 16, 5267, 74933, 25, 21149, 911, 1246, 279, 1372, 315, 23157, 39296, 1817, 882, 13, 3555, 1558, 419, 3291, 498, 911, 279, 5383, 5267, 36842, 25, 220, 18, 17, 198, 69769, 25, 1634, 369, 1449, 52740, 11, 279, 1372, 39296, 11, 432, 646, 387, 15251, 438, 220, 17, 86167, 320, 17, 311, 279, 2355, 308, 568, 5692, 308, 374, 279, 1372, 315, 41936, 804, 13, 1752, 3110, 11, 220, 17, 61, 18, 284, 220, 17, 353, 220, 17, 353, 220, 17, 284, 220, 23, 13, 1096, 374, 458, 3110, 315, 458, 58755, 6513, 1882, 1380, 279, 897, 27715, 6157, 438, 279, 1372, 315, 41936, 804, 12703, 382, 1474, 25, 2980, 498, 10339, 279, 3491, 30], encoder_prompt=None, encoder_prompt_token_ids=None, prompt_logprobs=None, outputs=[CompletionOutput(index=0, text=\" I'm not sure I understand it.\\nSystem: Of course!
