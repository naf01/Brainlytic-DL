The minimum value of x + 212 is 10000 as it's a 5-digit number. We get that the first two digits of x must be 10, hence the last two must be 01 (since it's a palindrome). There are only 3 possible cases for x + 212: 10001, 10101, or 10201. Only 10101 gives a valid palindrome value for x, which is 9889, and the sum of its digits is 34.\",\n            \"Thanks for helping.
